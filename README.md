# ZMK config for corne-like keyboard with dongle

The config allows you to use 3 n!n, one for the dongle, one for the left half, one for the right half. Using a dongle significantly increases battery life.. More details on the [slicemk page](https://www.slicemk.com/pages/split-dongle).

Config contains [Watchman's layout](https://github.com/aroum/Watchman-layouts).

This is a config for [Enki 42](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/qeq2qg/enki42_slim_ergo_keyboard/), but you can use it with corne or any other compatible keyboard.



You can change the name in line
```
CONFIG_ZMK_KEYBOARD_NAME="Enki42"
```
in file
```
config/boards/shields/enki42/enki42.conf
```
